# Babble

A chatting app that allows user to communicate with each other without having to register accounts. It uses React, a popular front-end library created and used heavily by Facebook as well as modern tools for Node including Webpack and Babel. <--- Hence the clever name ;)

=====================

Primarily a client-side SPA (single-page app) built with ReactJS
Contains a chat log displaying messages and notifications
Contains an input field to change your name and an input field to send a message
The client-side app communicates with a server via WebSockets for multi-user real-time updates
No persistent database is involved; the focus is on the client-side experience
